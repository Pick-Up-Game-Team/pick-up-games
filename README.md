## How It Works
Your README should include a section which describes the steps a fellow developer (you don't have to write for non-technical people -- assume your audience has a BS in CS) must take to run the tests for your software.  
Your instructions must:  
* Explain what software must be installed to run your software
* Explain how your software must be configured to run
* Be correct for the current release of your software. (you will lose points if we cannot run your test suite without significant assistance)

## Running Test Suite 
Your README must include instructions for running your test suites.  It is graded by the same guidelines as the documentation for running your application.
