## How It Works

The website is deployed and live at [Insert Website Here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Your README should include a section which describes the steps a fellow developer (you don't have to write for non-technical people -- assume your audience has a BS in CS) must take to run the tests for your software.  
Your instructions must:

- Explain what software must be installed to run your software
- Explain how your software must be configured to run
- Be correct for the current release of your software. (you will lose points if we cannot run your test suite without significant assistance)

## Running Test Suite

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - We use Selenium for our front-end testing. The tool helps with automating web applications for workflow, prompt, login/logout section, and other testing purposes.
