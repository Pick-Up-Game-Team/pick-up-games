## **How It Works**‚ö°
To run this software, install the latest version of Python 3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Then:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Inside the repo, a virtual environment using `py -m venv venv` (Windows) or `python3 -m venv venv` (Mac OS/Linux)
3. Activate the virtual environment with `venv/Scripts/activate` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac OS/Linux). On Windows machines, it may be necessary to enable scripts by running PowerShell as Administrator and entering `set-executionpolicy unrestricted`.
4. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. In the same directory as `settings.py`, create a file named `config.py` and enter this line in the file: `SECRET_KEY = '<secret_key>'` where `<secret_key>` can be any string. The secret key used in production is not shared on GitHub for security purposes.
6. Update the database with `python manage.py makemigrations` and then `python manage.py migrate`.
7. Run the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

The server can be accessed locally at http://localhost:8000/.

To create an admin user, use `python manage.py createsuperuser`. The admin panel can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/admin.

## Running Test Suite üñ•Ô∏è

- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - We use Selenium for our front-end testing. The tool helps with automating web applications for workflow, prompt, login/logout section, and other testing purposes. Back-end testing is done with the Django test suite, which integrates with Selenium.
  To run tests, run this command in your terminal:
    ```python
    python manage.py test
    ```
